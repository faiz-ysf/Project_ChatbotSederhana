## End Project of Foundation of Programming before end exam!!

"Chatbot_Sederhana" is my last first semester project in University of Indonesia. 

It includes:
1.) "Tanya Lelucon" ask the chatbot a (father) jokes!
2.) "Soal MTK" ask the chatbot an integral question!
3.) "Tanya Jam" ask the chatbot what is the current time!
4>) "XYZ" ask the chatbot a mysterious button?!???

What you can do:
1.) Save or reset your session
2.) Change into dark theme!

Thanks for seeing my small project!
